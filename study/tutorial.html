      <h3>Uncertainty in Heat Maps: Task One</h3>
        <p>
          In this study, you will be asked to interpret charts of data and uncertainty, and make predictions based on these charts.
          These charts represent <b>maps</b> of a region, where each location has an associated <b>value</b> and an <b>uncertainty</b> about that value.
          You will be presented with three kinds of charts.
        </p>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/juxtaposed.png" />
              <span>Two <i>side by side</i> charts. The map showing the data is on the left, and the map showing uncertainty is on the right. </span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/superimposed.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where each combination of data and uncertainty is given a different, unique color.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/vsup.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where, as we become more uncertain about data, the number of colors for showing the data decreases.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

         <p>
           There are two tasks in this study.
           In this first task, you will be given a chart, and asked to select a region in the chart that meets some criteria.
           For instance, you might be asked to click on a region with value of 0.2, and an uncertainty of 0.1.
           Select <b>any location you see</b> that meets the requirements. Click on a location to input your answer.
         </p>

         <div class="figure">
           <div>
             <img src="img/task1.png" />
             <span>An example of the first task. Any of the locations highlighted in red would be valid answers.</span>
           </div>
         </div>

         <p>
           Click the "Ready" button when you are ready to being the first task.
