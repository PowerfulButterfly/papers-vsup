      <h3>Uncertainty in Heat Maps</h3>
        <p>
          In this study, you will be asked to interpret charts of data and uncertainty, and make predictions based on these charts.
          These charts represent <b>maps</b> of a region, where each location has an associated <b>value</b> and an <b>uncertainty</b> about that value.
          You will be presented with three kinds of charts.
        </p>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/juxtaposed.png" />
              <span>Two <i>side by side</i> charts. The map showing the data is on the left, and the map showing uncertainty is on the right. </span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/superimposed.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where each combination of data and uncertainty is given a different, unique color.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="figure">
            <div>
              <img src="img/vsum.png" />
              <span>A <i>single</i> map where, as we become more uncertain about data, the number of colors for showing the data decreases.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

         <p>
           There are two tasks in this study.
           In the first task, you will be given a chart, and asked to select a region in the chart that meets some criteria.
           For instance, you may be asked to find the location on the map with the highest uncertainty.
           There may be multiple locations that meet the requirements.
           Select the <b>first location you see</b> that meets the requirements. Click on a location to input your answer.
         </p>

         <div class="figure">
           <div>
             <img src="img/task1.png" />
             <span>An example of the first task. The prompt was to find a location with <i>the lowest uncertainty</i>. Any of the locations highlighted in red would be valid answers.</span>
           </div>
         </div>

         <p>
           In the second task, you are either <i>attacking</i> or <i>defending</i> in a game like Battleship.
           In this game, each opponent places their ships on locations on the board, without letting the opponent see where they are placed.
           The player then selects locations to fire missiles. If a player fires missiles in the same square as an opponent's ship, that ship is sunk.
           A simulated forecasting model has indicated the likely locations of ships and missiles, but there are varying levels of uncertainty in the model's predictions.
           This means that predictions with high uncertainty may not be trustworthy.
         </p>

         <p>
           As an attacker, you will be shown a prediction of the likely locations of ships, along with the uncertainty in this prediction.
           Click locations to target them, or to remove targets. Once you have selected all of your targets, click the "Confirm" button.
           Your objective is to hit as many ships as possible.
         </p>

         <div class="figure">
           <div>
             <img src="img/task2a.png" />
             <span>An example of the <i>attacker</i> task.
               The location circled here in yellow is forecasted as being highly likely to contain ships, and the confidence in that forecast is high.
               The location circled in green is also forecasted as highly likely to contain ships, but the prediction confidence is much lower.
               The location circled in blue is somewhat likely to contain ships, but the confidence in this prediction is high.
               Either the orange or pink location would be a reasonable choice of target.
             </span>
           </div>
         </div>

         <p>
           As a defender, you will be shown a prediction of the likely locations of missile strikes, along with the uncertainty in these predictions.
           Click locations to place your ships, or to remove ships you previously placed. Once you have placed all of your ships, click the "Ready" button.
           Your objective is to have as few of your ships hit as possible.
         </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <div>
          <img src="img/task2b.png" />
          <span>An example of the <i>defender</i> task. Here, ships should be placed in the safest locations.
            Circled red location is unlikely to be targeted, and confidence in this prediction is high.
            The circled orange location is unlikely to be targeted, but confidence in this prediction is low.
            The circled pink location is more dangerous than the orange location, but with a much higher confidence in prediction.
            As with the attacking task, either the orange or pink locations would be reasonable places to put ships.
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Click the "Ready" button when you are ready to being the first task.
