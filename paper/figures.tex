	\caption{A standard bivariate map (left) and a VSUM (right), used to encode an identical 5x5 grid of random data. Both use the same visual channels to encode value (position along the Viridis~\cite{viridis} color map) and uncertainty (lightness and saturation), and have an equal standard of perceptual discriminability (at least 18 units of distance in CIELAB color space between colors). However, highly uncertain values result in colors that are very close together in the bivariate case, meaning the full bivariate map is only 9 bins under these constraints\,---\,a 4x4 map would result in colors that are perceptually too close together. By contrast, the VSUM intentionally reduces bins when uncertainty is high, eventually aliasing all highly uncertain values to the same color. This decision affords more distinct colors in other regions of the map, and so an increase in overall bins to 15. The resulting map suppresses the value of highly uncertain data, but increases the discriminability of data with low uncertainty.}

As glyphs become smaller, it becomes more difficult to distinguish their colors~\protect\cite{stone2014engineering}. VSUMs, by reducing the number of color categories as uncertainty increases, account for this ambiguity. On the right, the VSUM has been used to encode a 5x5 grid of random data.}

Bivariate color ramps ensure that there are orthogonal mappings for each combination of value and uncertainty, but, since color channels are not separable, can afford only a few discrete colors before color categories become unacceptably close, perceptually. Juxtaposed maps, by keeping these channels separate, afford a larger range of colors, but require a visual search task to recover both value and uncertainty in a region. VSUMs have many of the advantages of bivariate maps, but assign more color categories to certain data, at the expense of ambiguity when uncertainty is high.}

The ``defend'' framing is the opposite task: the participant has a list of likely missile locations, and ought to place their ships on locations with low probability of attack, and high certainty in this probability.}

			The number of discrete color categories in traditional bivariate color maps versus VSUMs, assuming value is encoded by the Viridis color map~\protect\cite{viridis}, and uncertainty is encoded by saturation/value (whiter values are more uncertain). Since these whiter uncertain colors are closer together in CIELAB space, and VSUMs intentionally require fewer color bins in those regions, VSUMs always have more color categories than the corresponding 2D bivariate map.

This guarantee removes some of the issues of non-separability and ambiguity that are otherwise a concern when designing bivariate maps. \\
		In this example two colors from the map for $n=9$ are too close in CIELAB space. Thus, we create a VSUM with $n=8$ color bins at the lowest level of uncertainty.}
