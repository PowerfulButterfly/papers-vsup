	\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{example.pdf}
	\caption{A standard bivariate map (left) and a VSUP (right), used to encode an identical 10x10 grid of random data. Both use the same visual channels to encode value (position along the Viridis~\protect\cite{viridis} color map) and uncertainty (lightness and saturation). However, the VSUP uses a tree-like structure to allocate colors, defining more bins when uncertainty is low. This non-uniform budgeting affords better discrimination between values when uncertainty is low, even though the VSUP has fewer color bins (in this case, 15 to the bivariate map's 16). This tree-like structure also discourages analysis in regions where uncertainty may be unacceptably high.}

As glyphs become smaller, it becomes more difficult to distinguish their colors~\protect\cite{stone2014engineering}. VSUPs, by reducing the number of color categories as uncertainty increases, account for this ambiguity. On the right, the VSUP has been used to encode a 5x5 grid of random data.}

Traditional bivariate maps integrate both value and uncertainty. VSUPs improve on traditional bivariate maps by reducing color resolution as uncertainty increases, discouraging conclusions based on noisy or imprecise data.}

Since these whiter uncertain colors are closer together in CIELAB space, and VSUPs intentionally require fewer color bins in those regions, VSUPs always have more color categories than the corresponding 2D bivariate map.

This guarantee removes some of the issues of non-separability and ambiguity that are otherwise a concern when designing bivariate maps. \\
%		In this example two colors from the map for $n=9$ are too close in CIELAB space. Thus, we create a VSUP with $n=8$ color bins at the lowest level of uncertainty.}
